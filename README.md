# MERN_Implement

A practice repository for implementing and understanding various MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack functionalities.

## 🔧 Functionalities Covered

This repo includes code and demos for:

- ✅ Sign Up / Sign In Authentication
- ✅ JWT (JSON Web Token) Authorization
- ✅ Socket.IO - Real-time Communication
- ⏳ File Uploads (Multer, Cloudinary, etc.)
- ⏳ CRUD APIs (with MongoDB + Mongoose)
- ⏳ Role-based Access Control
- ⏳ Email Sending (Nodemailer)
- ⏳ REST API and Express Routing
- ⏳ Payment Gateway Integration (Razorpay/Stripe)
- ⏳ Image Optimization and Caching
- ⏳ Search, Filter, Pagination
- ⏳ Rate Limiting, Helmet, CORS Security
- ⏳ Deployment (Render, Vercel, etc.)

## 🧠 Purpose

This project is a hands-on learning space where I build real-world features using the MERN stack. Each feature is built modularly so it can be reused in future full-stack projects.

## 📌 How to Use

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mayankgaur0405/Mern_Implement.git

# Go to a specific implementation folder
cd socket.io

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm run dev
